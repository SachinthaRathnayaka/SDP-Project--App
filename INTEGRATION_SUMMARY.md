## Future Recommendations

1. **Decommission Old Backend**: The standalone mobile backend is now obsolete and can be safely decommissioned

2. **Database Synchronization**: Consider adding database synchronization checks to ensure web and mobile data stays consistent

3. **API Versioning**: Consider implementing API versioning for mobile endpoints to allow for future changes

4. **Extended Testing**: 
   - Test all app flows with the new backend integration
   - Ensure all CRUD operations work correctly
   - Verify real-time updates and notifications

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Add monitoring for mobile-specific endpoints
   - Track usage patterns to optimize performance
